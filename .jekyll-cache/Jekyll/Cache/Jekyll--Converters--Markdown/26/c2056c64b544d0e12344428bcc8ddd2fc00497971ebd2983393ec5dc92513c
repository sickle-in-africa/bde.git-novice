I"Ω<p>The second big question for groups that want to open up their work is where to
host their code and data.  One option is for the lab, the department, or the
university to provide a server, manage accounts and backups, and so on.  The
main benefit of this is that it clarifies who owns what, which is particularly
important if any of the material is sensitive (i.e., relates to experiments
involving human subjects or may be used in a patent application).  The main
drawbacks are the cost of providing the service and its longevity: a scientist
who has spent ten years collecting data would like to be sure that data will
still be available ten years from now, but that‚Äôs well beyond the lifespan of
most of the grants that fund academic infrastructure.</p>

<p>Another option is to purchase a domain and pay an Internet service provider
(ISP) to host it.  This gives the individual or group more control, and
sidesteps problems that can arise when moving from one institution to another,
but requires more time and effort to set up than either the option above or the
option below.</p>

<p>The third option is to use a public hosting service like
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a>,or
<a href="https://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>.
Each of these services provides a web interface that enables people to create,
view, and edit their code repositories.  These services also provide
communication and project management tools including issue tracking, wiki pages,
email notifications, and code reviews.  These services benefit from economies of
scale and network effects: it‚Äôs easier to run one large service well than to run
many smaller services to the same standard.  It‚Äôs also easier for people to
collaborate.  Using a popular service can help connect your project with
communities already using the same service.</p>

<p>As an example, Software Carpentry <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry">is on GitHub</a> where you can find the <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice/edit/gh-pages/_episodes/13-hosting.md">source for this
page</a>. Anyone with a GitHub account can suggest changes to this text.</p>

<p>GitHub repositories can also be assigned DOIs, <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">by connecting its releases to
Zenodo</a>. For example,
<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/57467"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.5281/zenodo.57467</code></a> is the DOI that has
been ‚Äúminted‚Äù for this introduction to Git.</p>

<p>Using large, well-established services can also help you quickly take advantage
of powerful tools.  One such tool, continuous integration (CI), can
automatically run software builds and tests whenever code is committed or pull
requests are submitted.  Direct integration of CI with an online hosting service
means this information is present in any pull request, and helps maintain code
integrity and quality standards.  While CI is still available in self-hosted
situations, there is much less setup and maintenance involved with using an
online service.  Furthermore, such tools are often provided free of charge to
open source projects, and are also available for private repositories for a fee.</p>

  <h2 id="institutional-barriers">Institutional Barriers</h2>

  <p>Sharing is the ideal for science,
but many institutions place restrictions on sharing,
for example to protect potentially patentable intellectual property.
If you encounter such restrictions,
it can be productive to inquire about the underlying motivations and
either to request an exception for a specific project or domain,
or to push more broadly for institutional reform to support more open science.</p>

  <h2 id="can-my-work-be-public">Can My Work Be Public?</h2>

  <p>Find out whether you are allowed to host your work openly on a public forge.
Can you do this unilaterally,
or do you need permission from someone in your institution?
If so, who?</p>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="where-can-i-share-my-work">Where Can I Share My Work?</h2>

  <p>Does your institution have a repository or repositories that you can
use to share your papers, data and software? How do institutional repositories
differ from services like <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiV</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/">figshare</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>?</p>
